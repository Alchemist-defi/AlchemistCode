# Our Roadmap

**Short term:**

‌In the short term we are working on stabilising the platform, contracts and getting the word out. This includes extensive updates to the front end to clean it up, as well as provide clarity and better navigation.

‌**Listings**

‌We will continue to work on listing many coins tracking sites like Coin Market Cap and CoinGecko. These things take time and in most cases CMC and CG require a certain amount of liquidity and community interaction in order to be able to be listed. We will continue working on this front

‌**Marketing**

‌Marketing and brand awareness is as strong focus for the project, we have brought on Alchemist Bron who is a wizard with marketing and driving to ensure we create a strong market presence. Results from this is already showing.

‌**Pools/Farms**

‌Our focus and attention are on native tokens and native parings. As such you will see changes in the future to emphasize this. This will include introduction of native paired pools with high incentives to stake and farm. In addition, you will see changes coming which will be to reduce the incentive for the non-native pairs.

‌**Partnerships**

‌We have already approached \(and been approached by\) several fellow projects on BSC. A few announcements will be coming int he next few days about partnerships, but the key to understand here is that we are very selective in who we want to partner with. The main reason behind this is that we are looking to change the narrative and the landscape on BSC. We want to be open, honest and trustworthy providing a safe space for our community to invest and learn. With that said, we need to make sure that the partners we deal with are of the same philosophy.

‌**Medium term**

‌**Utility**

‌One of the biggest goals we must achieve on this project is utility. A token without utility is worthless, we want to continue working to ensure that our native tokens have utility and are sought after by those that hold them. With that, NFT's are a major part of the roadmap as well as a DAO. Both of which will be on our working roadmap going forward.

Without giving away too much, know that the purpose of the NFTs will be to provide a space for creators, but also a space where investors can buy NFTs that have additional functions in the ecosystem. Our NFTs will only be available to purchase with our native tokens and as such will create liquidity in the native tokens.
