# Partnerships

Our approach to partnerships is pretty straight forward. Projects that are looking to partner should follow the same values and philosophy that we do as a project. That being open, honest and pass through our due dilegence process. Overall we are not looking to partner with every project out there and in addition we are not looking to charge for partnerships. The agreement needs to be mutually beneficial. 

**Partnership completed so far.** 

* * [Knights Defi Partnership ](https://www.knightsdefi.com/)Great project, with a great team backing the project. The narrative behind knights fits well within our ecosystem and as such we have shared pools on each platform. 
    * Knights runs a MIST pool on their site. 
    * Alchemist runs a KNIGHT pool on our site.
  * \*\*\*\*[**BSCDog** ](https://bscdog.com/)**:** BSCDOG uses the dynamic RFI frictionless staking mechanism to reward holders. Each transaction incurs a 3% charge which is then redistributed to all token holders proportional to the amount of BSCDOG held.The team over at BSC Dog are solid and have the same mindset as we haev for our project. 

**Future Partnerships**
