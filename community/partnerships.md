# Partnerships

Our approach to partnerships is pretty straight forward. Projects that are looking to partner should follow the same values and philosophy that we do as a project. That being open, honest and pass through our due dilegence process. Overall we are not looking to partner with every project out there and in addition we are not looking to charge for partnerships. The agreement needs to be mutually beneficial. 

**Partnership completed so far.**
