# Breeds of OWL

There are 4 different breeds of owls, namely;&#x20;

* PHOENIX OWLS&#x20;
* BARN OWLS&#x20;
* EAGLE OWLS
* SCREECH OWLS&#x20;

Phoenix Owls are the rarest of the Owls of Origin. There are only 86 Phonix Owls in total, 81 of which will be available through staking.&#x20;

Phoenix owls offer two main benefits, namely:&#x20;

* They are rarer than all other breeds
* They have a statistical advantage in getting a higher level of characteristics over other breeds.&#x20;

By holding a Phoenix Owl not only do you hold a rare NFT you also have an advantage in breeding activities. Any child bred with a Phoenix owl has a chance of being a phoenix owl and therefore a chance of achieving rarer characteristics - See breeding section.

All other breeds (Barn, Eagle and Screech Owls) are equal in comparison to each other in their statistical ability to achieve higher characteristics.&#x20;

In later updates to the game each regular breed will be stronger in a specific area of the Island of Aura.
