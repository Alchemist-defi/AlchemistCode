# Owl Characteristics

Every owl has 4 main characteristics. Each characteristic offers a different in-game benefit. The characteristics are as follows.&#x20;

* Claw size&#x20;
* Wingspan&#x20;
* Sight&#x20;
* Origin level&#x20;

Claw size: Claw size determines how many resources an Owl can carry.&#x20;

Wingspan: Determines the speed at which the Owl can fly&#x20;

Sight: Determines how well the Owl can hunt and find resources&#x20;



### Characteristic Levels

Each characteristic will have an ability rating from (in order of ability and rarity)&#x20;

* Magical (most powerful and most rare)&#x20;
* Legendary&#x20;
* Average&#x20;
* Below average (least powerful and least rare)&#x20;

### How Will Charactistics Benefits You In-Game?

In our expansion, we are going to open various sections of the Island of Aura. These sections will contain different resources all of which will have specific abilities.&#x20;

These resources will all you to create spells to gain an advantage on the Island. More details on resources will be released with the expansion.

The more resources you have the more spells you can create, the more advanced your island will become.&#x20;

Players can sell resources and spells created from resources in the marketplace, so if players want to generate an income from resources, they need owls to fetch those resources for them to be sold.&#x20;

The ability to fetch a resource will be impacted by:&#x20;

* Where the resource is located on the Island (how far the Owl will have to travel) - An Owl with a greater wingspan can fly faster to the resource than an Owl with an average wingspan, therefore making a trip faster.&#x20;
* How much of the resource the Owl can carry on a single trip - An Owl with a larger claw size can carry more resources in a single trip than an Owl with an average claw size.&#x20;
* How quickly your Owl can find resources once they are in a resource area - A smaller resource is more difficult to see, and therefore harder to find. An Owl with a higher level of sight would find this resource faster than an average Owl Characteristics tables The following table is applicable for the different levels of characteristics.

### Characteristics Table

|           | Units         | Magical | Legendary | Average | Below Average |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| Claw Size | Resource      | 13      | 9         | 6       | 4             |
| Wingspan  | Speed         | 0.8     | 0.9       | 1       | 1.1           |
| Sight     | Hunting Speed | 0.8     | 0.9       | 1       | 1.1           |

### Characteristics Examples

#### Claw Size Example

An Owl with an average claw size would be able to collect 6 units of a resource. Where an owl with a Magical claw size would be able to collect 13 units of the same resource.&#x20;

#### Wingspan Example

If a resource is 1 hour away, An Owl with an average wingspan would take 1 hour to reach the resource and 1 hour to return from the resource, completing a round trip in 2 hours.&#x20;

* 1 Hour X 2 (round trip) X 1 (average factor) = 2 hours flying time&#x20;

An Owl with a magical wingspan however would take:

* 1 Hour X 2 (round trip) X 0.8 (magical factor) = 1.6 hours flying time&#x20;

#### Sight Example

Sight influences how quickly a resource can be found. Each resource on the Island will have a different difficulty level. This will make certain resources on the Island rarer as they are more difficult to collect.&#x20;

Difficulty rating will be based on hours. So a resource with a difficulty rating of 2 would require 2 hours to obtain a full claw size as opposed to a resource with a difficulty rating of 4, which would require the Owl to “search” for 4 hours.&#x20;

In the above example, an Owl with average sight would require 2 hours calculated as:&#x20;

* 2 hours X 1 (average factor)&#x20;

to find its claw size of resources. If you assume an average Claw size, it would take 2 hours to find 6 resources.&#x20;

Where an Owl with Magical sight would take 1.6 hours calculated as:

* 2 hours X 0.8 (magical factor) = 1.6 hours&#x20;

to find its claw size of resources. If you assume an average Claw size, it would take 1.6 hours to find 6 resources.&#x20;

### Origin Level

The “Owls of Origin” are exactly that. The original Owls were first found on the Island of Aura by Hugo.

The lower the Origin level number the more magical your owl can be. Level 1 has an advantage over level 5 for example.

The origin level of your Owl will determine its statistical edge in getting magical characteristics.

For example, a level 1 owl has a higher chance of getting magical characteristic status than a level 10.
