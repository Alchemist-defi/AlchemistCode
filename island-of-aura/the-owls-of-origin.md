# The Owls Of Origin

There will only ever be 449 Owls of Origin.&#x20;

Pre minted owls can only be “rented” by staking a certain amount of MIST (native token) in a staking pool.&#x20;

Players will only have access to an Owl of Origin for as long as the required amount of MIST is staked in the owl pool.&#x20;

Players will be able to see the Origin Owl characteristics and choose which owl they want to stake in.

If any player unstakes the predetermined amount of MIST from the staking pool that player will no longer have access to the Origin Owl and his Owl will then be available for staking by any other player. Players can breed their Owls of Origin owls provided that their funds are staked. (See Breeding) While the user is breeding any pre-minted owl, their funds become locked and are only available for withdrawal after the breeding process has been completed. The breeding process is expected to only take a matter of minutes but may vary depending on chain traffic.

### Owls of Origin Pre-Minting Schedule

The following table breaks down the number of Owls of Origin per level and per breed and includes a team allocation of owls:

| Level                 | Phoenix | Barn | Eagle | Screech | Total |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---- | ----- | ------- | ----- |
| Level 1               | 8       | 11   | 11    | 11      | 41    |
| Level 2               | 11      | 16   | 16    | 16      | 59    |
| Level 3               | 16      | 22   | 22    | 22      | 82    |
| Level 4               | 22      | 31   | 31    | 31      | 115   |
| Level 5               | 29      | 41   | 41    | 41      | 152   |
| Owls of Origin        | 86      | 121  | 121   | 121     | 449   |
| Team Owls\*           | 5       | 5    | 5     | 5       | 20    |
| Available for staking | 81      | 116  | 116   | 116     | 429   |

\*There will be 20 team Owls that will be per minted and transferred to the dev wallet. These team Owls will include one owl per breed per level. Team Owls will never be available for sale and will be used by the team to generate children owls to sell in the marketplace as a way to fund future developments of the project. Team Owls will be subject to the exact same breeding limitations, calculations and fees as all other Owls. In total the team allocation is less than 5% of the total supply. The dev wallet address is also publicly available for inspection at any point in time.

### Fees on staking Owls Of Origin

For every transaction that occurs using our native tokens, 2% is burned immediately.&#x20;

This 2% transfer burn happens automatically in every transaction.&#x20;

When staking for an Owl of Origin the fees will be the normal transaction fees noted above + BSC transaction costs.&#x20;

When a player unstakes from an Owl of Origin a 2% unstaking fee will be charged, similar to the deposit fees in the defi pools and farms.&#x20;

This fee will be used to:&#x20;

* Fund further project development and utility&#x20;
* Used in marketing activities including competitions, giveaways and community growth&#x20;
* Buyback and burn native tokens as needed to maintain a stable price.&#x20;

While MIST is staked in an Owl of Origin the user will not be able to stake the same MIST in a pool/farm.

### Staking Limitations

Only one player can stake for a specific Owl of Origin at a time.&#x20;

One user should be able to stake for multiple Owls of Origin, however, no one player should be able to stake for more than one of each level of the same breed. For example, you will be able to stake for a Level 1 Barn Owl and level 1 Phoenix Owl but you would not be able to stake for 2 Level 1 Barn Owls.

The above limitations means that no one player will be able to hold more than 4 Level 1 Owls of Origin - one of each breed.

On the release of the Owls of Origin, no play will be able to stake for more than 6 Owls of Origin in the same wallet. This will allow players a maximum of 3 breeding pairs. This limit will be lifted when the Island of Aura is opened and further developments are made to the project with the formal release of the Aviary NFT.

The above limitation is implemented as a form of “whale protection’ and to promote free access to these Owls.

The team allocation below is subject to the same level constraints. Once team Owls are minted to the dev wallet, a total of 15 Owls will be transferred to wallets allocated to 3 team members to agree with the wallet constraint. All transfers will be made public and the transaction details will be released so that any player can keep track of these team owls.

### Access to pre-minted Owls of Origin

Access to the Owls of Origin available for staking will be on a first-come-first-served basis. When the Owl pools open the players whose transaction is completed first on the BSC network will be allocated the Owl. (See Roadmap)

If a player unstakes from an Owl of Origin, the first player to identify the availability of a staking slot and successfully stake in the Owl will have access to the Owl.

Please note that we do not have control over whose transaction is recorded first on the network and successful transactions are subject to network traffic present at the time of staking.

### Cost of pre-minted Owls

Staked Owls of Origin are accessible only by staking a required amount of MIST.

The value of MIST required for each breed and level will remain constant and will never change.

The following table reflects the amount of MIST required to be staked for each level and type of owls where regular breed owls refer to Barn, Eagle and Screech Owls.

| Level   | Phoenix   | Regular   |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| Level 1 | 8500 MIST | 5100 MIST |
| Level 2 | 6800 MIST | 4100 MIST |
| Level 3 | 5400 MIST | 3250 MIST |
| Level 4 | 4300 MIST | 2600 MIST |
| Level 5 | 3400 MIST | 2050 MIST |
