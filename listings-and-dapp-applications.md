# Listings and dApp Applications

Our standard process for applications is to follow the channels that each site requires. If we don't receive any response in a week, we reapply the following week .

For sites that require significant upfront capital to get listed, we will usually park these on the back burner until the project has funding. At that stage, we will re-consider spending capital to list on those sites \(If the community agrees\)

Note that applying and being successful on exhanges is a major challenge for a small project, but you as the community can help by making suggestions and also upvoting or spreading the word in your communities.
