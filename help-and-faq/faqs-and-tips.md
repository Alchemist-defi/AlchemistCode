## What do I do if I cannot see my LP's in the "Liquidity" page

If you have already unstaked your LP's from the farms and you would like to redeem the LP's back to their original tokens, you would normally navigate to Trade &gt; Liquidity and then remove your LP's 

If for any reason you cannot see your LP's in that list you can always go directly to "remove" page for a given pair. All you need are the 2 token addresses and the following URL

[https://exchange.alchemistdefi.com/\#/remove/0x6f8FE12CC34398d15b7D5A5BA933E550DA1D099f/0xaB329b1B7785be9f954bacFc7Fa663Ce9b36338d](https://exchange.alchemistdefi.com/#/remove/0x6f8FE12CC34398d15b7D5A5BA933E550DA1D099f/0xaB329b1B7785be9f954bacFc7Fa663Ce9b36338d)

The URL above is broken down into the URL for the exchange then \#/remove/token1address/token2address. You can substitute those addresses if needed.
